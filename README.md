# password-generator

In this module we were given starter code to help develop a password generator on random assignment

We were tasked with ensuring that multiple sets of conditions were met, and also if it fell outside of those boundaries that the script would throw error messages to ensure your contained within the correct parameters.

This module was very focused on learning how to use arrays and dissect certain pertain information out of them to display the proper password on screen.

Validating for special characters, numbers, upper and lower case letters while using if statements to make sure it does not fall out of the tree.

This assignment also dealt with the differences between the prompt command and confirm command. Where prompt will allow you to take input back in as a value. Where as confirm is just a boolean proving true or false for a certain scenario.

This also forced you to be able to take a different variable type and convert it so it was a parsable attritube to be used in other parts of the code.


Throughout this assignment i found myself breaking the code multiple times trying to just fix minor issues, but as i learned with keeping the password in the parameters it was very easy to break and try again.
